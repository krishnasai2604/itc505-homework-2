	<center><h1><strong>Abstract</strong></h1></center>
	<P>While much has been written on the dire need for workers who understand both the IT and OT core concepts necessary to protect the cyber-physical systems of critical infrastructure, practical and specific recommendations for how to meet this need through education and workforce training are lacking. Many of the available programs for teaching cybersecurity of physical systems rely on virtual simulations and students may not encounter relevant physical equipment until they are in the workplace. RADICL’s Cyber-physical Shooting Gallery is a critical missing piece toward a comprehensive system to develop the competent workforce the nation needs. Through a series of cyber-physical capture-the-flag challenges that integrate the Purdue ICS Model with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, the Cyber-physical Shooting Gallery provides an accessible educational model for cyber-physical security education and training.<p>

	<center><h1>INTRODUCTION: BUILDINGA PURPLE UNICORN</h1></center>
	<p>In   May   of   2022,   the   Idaho   National   Laboratory’s   Industrial  Cybersecurity  Community  of  Practice  (ICSCOP) held an education and training workshop titled ‘Developing Industrial   Cyber   Personnel   Instead   of   Chasing   Purple   Unicorns’. Researchers, government officials, and industrial leaders spoke on the pressing and difficult problem of finding the  “purple  unicorn”–namely,  workers  who  can  bridge  the  skills,  education,  and  cultural  divide  between  information  technology   (IT)   that   is   largely   centered   on   data   and   operational technology (OT) that is the world of monitoring and controlling physical systems. Indeed, as of 2018, over a decade  after  Stuxnet  and  years  after  the  world  watched  cyberattacks  bring  down  Ukraine’s  power  grid,  there  were  only two programs out of the more than 200 National Centers for Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense (NCAE-CD) that qualified  with  an  Industrial  Control  Systems  focus  [1].  According    to    Ralph    Ley,    manager    of    Workforce    Development and Training at Idaho National Laboratory, “If cybersecurity  is  among  the  top  national  security  concerns faced  by  the  nation,  industrial  cybersecurity  must  be  the  single most critical overlooked educational topic” [2].<p>
	<p>Standard  programs  in  cybersecurity  typically  have  very  little if any exposure to “getting your hands dirty” with real physical   equipment.   Likewise,   technical   and   vocational   training   programs   traditionally   have   little   emphasis   on   cybersecurity training. This gap needs to be addressed from both  directions,  both  in  education  and  in  the  workplace.  In  recent years, several virtual simulations have been developed to  teach  security  of  cyber-physical  systems  and  critical  infrastructure  [3],  [4].  While  these  simulation  games  have  been  well-received  with  students  and  provide  important  multidisciplinary  experience  with  complexity  that  is  not  otherwise  available,  they  lack  actual  interaction  with  the  physical  components  themselves.  As  Dr.  Sean  McBride,  a  leader  in  researching  and  advocating  for  improvements  in  ICS  cyber-physical  education,  says,  “It  may  be  difficult  to  commence  a  career  securing  devices  that  one  has  never  before seen, let alone never handled and experienced” [5].<p>
	<p>There  have  been  recent  efforts  to  address  this  need  for  hands-on training in ICS cybersecurity. LICSTER is a low-cost,  open  source  testbed  developed  by  researchers  at  the  Hochschule   Augsburg   in   Germany   that   uses   a   model conveyor belt and punching machine to demonstrate a series of   attack   scenarios   [6].   KYPO4INDUSTRY   is   an   ICS   training  laboratory  in  the  Czech  Republic  that  includes  a  simulated industrial environment for courses that require the students  to  study  attacks  and  develop  their  own  game  scenarios  [7].  This  paper  presents  the  RADICL  Cyber-physical   Shooting   Gallery   which   aims   to   provide   an   engaging,  replicable  platform  for  students  to  gain  hands-on experience   with   the   security   challenges   of   real   cyber-physical systems.<p>

	<center><h1>DEVELOPING A CYBER-PHYSICALEDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT</h1></center>
	<p>The Reconfigurable Attack-Defend Instructional Computing Laboratory (RADICL) is a hands-on educational and research computing laboratory that has been evolving to meet  the  needs  of  new  cybersecurity  challenges  since  its  creation at the University of Idaho in 2004 [8], [9]. Funding from the state of Idaho and grants from NSF have enabled it to   develop   an   isolated   and   controlled   environment   for   students  and  researchers  to  engage  in  realistic attack  and  defense scenarios working with actual malware in real-time, while  also  creating  data  sets  for  additional  research  and  learning.  Adding  the  additional  capability  for  hands-on cyber-physical  attack  and  defense  will  make  RADICL  a  unique  environment  poised  to  help  fill  the  IT-OT  gap  in  current cybersecurity education.<p>
    <p>The Cyber-physical Shooting Gallery consists of a series of  small-scale  platforms  hung  on  the  walls  around  the  laboratory, providing targets with real physical responses as students  attempt  attack  and  defense  techniques.  The  goal  is  to   provide   a   reconfigurable   introductory   platform   for   studying   the   security   of   cyber-physical   systems.   The   challenges  are  designed  with  a  low  bar  and  high  ceiling,  enabling students and workers to become more comfortable with   the   crossover   between   IT   and   OT   and   begin   to   understand  the  threat  model  of  industrial  control  systems  (ICS). The platforms provide a progression of challenge for students to gain experience with a variety of physical systems and their controls, the logic of the cyber kill chain as applied to   cyber-physical   systems,   the   significance   of   network   segmentation  and  the  Purdue  ICS  Model,  and  some  of  the  relevant methods of attack and defense.<p>
	<p> Standardized:  Each  platform  in  the  Cyber-physical Shooting  Gallery  is  self-contained  on  a  16”  by  32”  metal  pegboard that can be hung on a wall or set up on a table with a  stand.  The  top  half  of  the  platforms  are  standardized  to  enable a streamlined process for creating new OT challenges and  to  provide  some  familiarity  for  students  as  they  work  through  the  challenges.  The  authors  have  also  developed  a  template for planning the attack surface and designs for new platforms,  making  it  possible  for  others  to  more  easily  contribute a design for a new cyber-physical challenge.<p>

	<center><h1>CONCLUSION</h1></center>
	<p>The education and workforce development necessary to meet the global needs for securing critical infrastructure and other cyber-physical systems will require a multi-faceted and coordinated approach. Fortunately, the intrinsically hands-on nature of cyber-physical education is very well suited to early education. Our experience with summer cybersecurity camps for middle and high school students for the past six years has shown that students respond enthusiastically to opportunities to  build  and  program  their  own  circuits  with  Raspberry  Pis  and  simple  sensors  and  actuators.  The  opportunity  to  build  and creatively design physical projects pulls in a wider range of  students  than  more  narrowly  focused  coding  programs.  McBride   [5]   advocates   a   coordinated   and   vertically integrated pathway beginning with such early school camps and    clubs    and    building    through    technical    schools,    universities, and employers.<p>
    <p>There   are   many   roadblocks   to   overcome,   including   cultural and educational barriers between workers in IT and OT [16], the sparsity of current dedicated programs for ICS cybersecurity,   and   financial   hurdles   to   recruiting   the   necessary expertise for teaching these skills. However, there is momentum building toward addressing these issues. There have  been  recent  efforts  to  develop  comprehensive  ICS  cybersecurity  curricular  guidance  [17],  [18],  to  develop  project-based,  hands-on  ICS  tasks  [19],  [20],  to  develop  open-source  training  materials  for  operational  technicians  [21], and to develop multidisciplinary certificates or degrees that  bridge  computer  science,  industrial  technology,  and  engineering [22], [23].<p>
	<p>This  paper  presents  a  novel  approach  to  deploying  a  scalable  and  repeatable  platform  for  engaging  students  in  adversarial   thinking   about   cyber-physical   systems.   The RADICL Cyber-physical Shooting Gallery is intended to fill an entry-level role in developing comfort with the interplay between cybersecurity and physical systems in an engaging and non-threatening way. It can provide a key bridge between jeopardy-style CTFs and virtual simulations and larger scale test-bed  challenges  [24],  [25],  hopefully  de-mystifying  the  field and enticing more students into the joys and challenges of working with cyber-physical systems.<p>
